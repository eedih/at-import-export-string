  "<h2><b>Build a Strong Foundation</b></h2><p>In this activity, we’ll zoom in on each macronutrient and look at how it works, why it’s important, and where you can find it on your plate or in your pantry.&nbsp;</p><h4><b>Carbs = Fuel</b></h4><p>Fad diets have historically given carbohydrates a bad rap. But really, carbs are a main player in providing energy to your body, particularly your brain, nerves, and muscles.&nbsp;</p><p>The body breaks down most food we eat into sugar molecules called glucose, which is used as energy. If the body doesn’t use it right away, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in the liver and muscles. During physical activity, muscle glycogen is converted to glucose and used as fuel. As glycogen stores are used up–usually during lengthy workouts around 90 minutes or longer–you start to feel tired and the body starts to break down fat and lean muscle for energy. Who wants to lose their hard earned muscle mass to be used as fuel? Not us.&nbsp;</p><p>Eating enough carbohydrates can improve performance and prevent injury while maintaining muscle mass, stamina, quick thinking–all leading to improved performance and injury prevention. Quick-acting simple carbs are ideal for exercise because they quickly replenish blood sugar.

But really, carbs are a main player in providing energy to your body, particularly your brain, nerves, and muscles.&nbsp;</p><p>The body breaks down most food we eat into sugar molecules called glucose, which is used as energy. If the body doesn’t use it right away, glucose is stored in the body as glycogen in the liver and muscles. During physical activity, muscle glycogen is converted to glucose and used as fuel. As glycogen stores are used up–usually during lengthy workouts around 90 minutes or longer–you start to feel tired and the body starts to break down fat and lean muscle for energy. Who wants to lose their hard earned muscle mass to be used as fuel?

That can put you at higher risk for a dangerous fall.</p><p>Flexibility is what helps your muscles stay loose, so that your joints move more easily.</p><p>One way to keep your balance and flexibility skills in tip top shape is with exercise.
